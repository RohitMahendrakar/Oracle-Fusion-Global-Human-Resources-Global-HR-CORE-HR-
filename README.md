## üìò Overview

**Global Human Resources (Global HR / Core HR)** in Oracle Fusion forms the foundation for workforce management.  
It defines enterprise structures, legal and payroll entities, workforce classifications (jobs, positions, grades), and shared reference data required for HR, payroll, and talent processes.  

Use these configurations to model your organization for:
- Accurate HR reporting  
- Seamless payroll integration  
- Statutory compliance  
- Standardized employee management  

([docs.oracle.com][1])

## ‚úÖ Implementation Notes & Best Practices

* Use **Enterprise Structures Configurator (ESC)** to define the full enterprise structure in one guided flow. ([docs.oracle.com][3])  
* Configure **Geographies** first ‚Äî many validations depend on geography setup. ([docs.oracle.com][2])  
* Always associate **Legislative Data Groups** to PSUs for statutory compliance. ([docs.oracle.com][6])  
* Keep **DFFs** well-documented and minimal to maintain data integrity.  
* Maintain naming standards for Jobs, Positions, and Departments for easier reporting and integration.
